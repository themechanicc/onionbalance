Overview
========

OnionBalance is the best way to load balance onion services across multiple
backend Tor instances. This way the load of introduction and rendezvous
requests get distributed across multiple hosts. OnionBalance provides
load-balancing while also making onion services more resilient and reliable by
eliminating single points-of-failure.

Quickstart
============

Onionbalance supports both v2 and v3 onions but because of the different setup
procedure, we have separate guides for them.

See the :ref:`tutorial_v3` page for setting up a v3 onionbalance, or the
:ref:`tutorial_v2` page for setting up a v2 onionbalance.
